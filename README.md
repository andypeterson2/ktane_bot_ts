# ktane_bot_ts
AI assistant for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. A (hopefully) simple voice recognition bot to respond to basic user input and assist in bomb defusal for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. If I can't finish this project by the time FA21 starts then this project will likely be abandoned until I have free time. This is mainly a passion project for myself since nobody ever wants to play KTANE for more than 5 min at a time.
